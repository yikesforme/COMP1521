1. When we running out of physical memory in the Process Address Space. 
   If there is not enough memory in the Process Address Space, then a call to fork() will fail.
2. Execve only returns a value (-1) if the successful call has no process to return to. 
   The return value will be -1 in this value, and the flag, errno, will be set to reflect this error.
3. Investigate what caused the issue, send SIGKILL to child. 
   Potentially try to create another process to ensure that the execve was executed.
