Question 5 (5 marks)
Assume that we have the following 16-bit variables defined and initialised:

unsigned short a, b, c;
a = 0x5555;  b = 0xAAAA;  c = 0x0001;
What are the values of the following expressions:

  a | b (bitwise OR)

  a & b (bitwise AND)

  a ^ b (bitwise XOR)

  a & (b << 1)

  a & ~c

Give your answer in hexadecimal, but you might find it easier to convert to binary to work out the solution.
