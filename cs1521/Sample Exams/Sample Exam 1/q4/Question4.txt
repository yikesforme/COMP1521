Question 4 (5 marks)
C functions have a number of different ways of dealing with errors:

terminating the program entirely (rare)
setting the system global variable errno
returning a value that indicates an error (e.g. <@>NULL)
setting a returning parameter to an error value
They might even use a combination of the above.

Think about how the following code might behave for each of the inputs below (i.e. the final value for each variable):

int n, a, b, c;
n = scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c)
Inputs:

  42 64 999

  42 64.4 999

  42 64 hello

  42 hello there

  hello there
