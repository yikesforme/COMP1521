Question 9 (3 marks)
Consider a process whose address space is partitioned into 4KB pages and the pages are distributed across the memory as shown in the diagram below:


The low byte address in the process is 0 (in Code1) and the top byte address in the process is 28671 (max address in page containing Stack2).

For each of the following process addresses (in decimal notation), determine what physical address it maps to.

  jal func, where the label func is at 5096

  lw $s0,($sp), where $sp contains 28668

  la $t0, msg where the label msg is at 10192

Type the answer to this question into the file called q9.txt and submit it using the command:
